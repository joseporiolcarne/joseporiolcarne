Hello, my name is **Josep Oriol CarnÃ©**, and I'm a Software Engineer with extensive experience in the FinTech and banking sectors. I'm deeply passionate about algorithmic trading and machine learning.

## Technical Skills and Philosophies

### Programming Languages

- **Python & Java**: My primary tools for constructing the backbone of scalable, efficient applications.
- **A Nod to the Classics**: With a respectful bow to COBOL, LotusScript, and WebFOCUS, I acknowledge the roads less traveled (by newer generations, at least).

### Tools and Technologies

- **Frameworks**: Proficient in utilizing Flask, Django, and FastAPI for Python; Spring Boot for Java; and not forgetting the versatile PHP, to develop applications that not only stand the test of time but also scale efficiently across diverse environments.
- **Machine Learning**: Deeply engrossed in the world of machine learning, employing libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch alongside Python to unlock predictive insights.
- **Database Proficiency**:
	- **Oracle** for secure, enterprise-level data management,
	- **PostgreSQL** for comprehensive query capabilities and scalability,
	- **ChromaDB** for applications related to AI and vector databases, and	
	- **DB2**, integrated with COBOL, to extend the legacy systems' vitality for another 60 years

## Staying Informed and Entertained

- ðŸ›  **Productivity Tools Enthusiast**: Exploring productivity tools is one of my favorite hobby that ironically consumes more time than it saves. It's a paradox I live with, in pursuit of the ultimate workflow.
- â˜• **Coffee Connoisseur**: My day is fuelled by coffee meticulously reheated in the microwave and slightly overcooked.
- ðŸ“° **News Intake**: I stay connected to the world through a few curated mix of monthly newsletters and lively discussions with friends and family. Zero TV, zero newspapers, and absolutely no social media news.

## Current Endeavors

- **Project Mutatrader**: At the forefront of my current projects is Mutatrader, a venture into the genetic programming aimed at evolving sophisticated investment and trading strategies. Like Charles Darwin with a brokerage account.

## Ultrarunning

- **Beyond Code**: When not coding, I embark on ultrarunning quests. With five 100-mile races under my belt and a sixth on the horizon. What doesn't kill you...

## Let's Connect

Whether you wish to discuss some projects, exchange ultrarunning tales, or debate the merits of reheated coffee, my digital door is always open.
